    “Dressed in new jeans, a light blue dress shirt and a red patterned tie, he stood at Heathers grave with his eyes closed.<br>
     Although I didnt hear him, his lips were moving like he was praying.<br>
      In the faint breeze, Mother Nature ran her fingers through his dark hair like I wanted to.<br>
       He looked tall and strong, the way he used to, but somewhere along the way, without me, hed stepped into the shoes of a man.<br>
        And a part of me ached for those missing years.”
